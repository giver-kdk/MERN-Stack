- Above files contains the code logic for different topics of Express.js
- Copy code form those respective 'main.js' files and paste on 'app.js'
- Type 'npm start' to run the application 


NOTE: 
- The code logic('main.js') is separated to avoid installment of multiple 'node_modules'
- This is done just for the learning purpose 
- In real world scenario, we have to separately create 'node_modules' for respective apps
