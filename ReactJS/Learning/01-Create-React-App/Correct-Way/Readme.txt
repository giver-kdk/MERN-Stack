To create a new react app project, use command: 
	- npx create-react-app my-app
Here, "my-app" is the project folder name and it should be lowercased.



To run/test the react app, use command: 
	- npm start



To create production build, use command:

NOTE: 
- "index.html" is the main HTML file that gets rendered
- "index.js" is the main JS file included in "index.html"
- "App.js" is the JS file where we write React.JS codes
- Type "rf" + "Enter" for a react component boilerplate
